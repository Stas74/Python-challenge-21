# Challenge
# Dot wants to visit all the London landmarks where the wait time is less than 15 minutes. We have a dictionary called landmarks, within which landmark names are keys and wait times are their respective values.

# Using Python, develop a list of the landmarks where the wait time is less than 15 minutes. What will be the length of the list?

# dictionary where 
landmarks = {

    "Tower Bridge": 25,
    "Buckingham Palace": 15,
    "Madame Tussauds": 25,
    "London Eye": 40,
    "Tower of London": 25,
    "Emirates Air Line cable car": 16,
    "London Transport Museum": 7,
    "Wembley Stadium": 8,
