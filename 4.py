# Challenge
# Dot doesn't travel to Europe often, so they decide to take the most expensive option for each course as well as drink. Create a new dictionary called meals that will contain the names of the courses as the keys (starters, mains...), and the name of the food or drink item as the values.

# After assembling the dictionary appropriately, when Dot gives a 10% tip on this meal, how much will the tip come out to?
