# Simple User-Defined Functions in Python

# def name_of_function(<input parameter>, <input parameter 2>):
#     '''
#     code
#     '''
#     return output

# The keyword return doesn't always have to be at the end of the function. We can use it elsewhere, 
# for example if we want to return the first number from a list thatâ€™s divisible by three.

# def return_right_number(input_numbers):
#     for i in range(len(input_numbers)):
#         if input_numbers[i] % 3 == 0:
#             return input_numbers[i]
#         else :
#             continue
#     return "Number does not exist"

# Challenge
# The airport uses sensors to keep track of all its airplane gates, and monitor which ones are available. 
# Every time an airplane needs to park at a gate, the system directs them to an available spot for that particular airplane type, 
# or notifies them that no spots are available.

# We need to write a function called find_the_gate() that returns the coordinates of an available gate, 
# or returns false if there is no available spot. Our function receives a list representing all gates, 
# and a string with the type of airplane that is looking for a gate.

# There are 2 kinds of possible airplanes: Narrow-Body (Single aisle) or Wide-Body.

# Wide-Body planes can only use gates in W spots.
# Narrow-Body planes can use gates in either N** or **W spots.

# In the list of gates, gates are written in either lower-case or upper-case. 
# An upper-case letter means that the particular gate is AVAILABLE, while a lower-case letter means that the gate is UNAVAILABLE.

# Our function must return a number with the position of the gate where the airplane can park. See the example input and output below for an illustration.

# Note: There may be multiple available spots for a particular airplane. 
# If that happens, our function should return the first possible spot to minimize the airplane taxiing time. 
# If there are no available gates, remember to return boolean value False.

# Input
def find_the_gate(spots, vehicle):
    # Code here!
    letter = vehicle[0].capitalize()
    # print(letter)
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(spots)):        
        if letter == spots[i]:
            return counter
        counter += 1
    return False
        
    # print(spots[i])


print(find_the_gate(
  ['w','n','N'], 'narrow'
))

print(find_the_gate(
  ['w','n','N','W','n','W'],'wide'
))

print(find_the_gate(
  ['w','n','n','w','n','n'], 'narrow'
))

# Expected Output
# 2
# 3
# False

# What will be the output of:

print(find_the_gate(
  ['w','n','n','w','N','n','w','N','N','w','n','n','w','n','n','W','W','W','W','n','n','w','n','n'], 'wide'
))
